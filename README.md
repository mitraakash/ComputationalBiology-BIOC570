# ComputationalBiology-BIOC570
Project for Computational Biology BIOC570 Fall 2017
Collaboration between Akash Mitra and Iman Sahnoune

Main files used to run the code were 'MainProjectCode.m' in the Matlab environment, and 'GBM_Expression.r' in R. Other scripts were used as functions in computing the image extraction. The nii files were not uploaded to the rep due to limitations in size but the NIFTI toolbox for Matlab was primarily used for working with the data (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image)
